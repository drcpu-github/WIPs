## Abstract

A mechanism is proposed for enabling risk-mitigated protocol upgrades by allowing block producers to signal support
for specific protocol improvements, so that activation of those can automatically happen right after a supermajority
of the network has signaled support for those rules for a certain period of time.

The [WIP process][WIP-0001] is also revised to take into account automated activation of protocol improvements.

## Motivation and rationale

> **Disclaimer**: This proposal focuses strictly on the technical and procedural aspects of activating protocol
> improvements. Any governance aspects are not discussed herein. All uses of *"support for"* or any similar
> expressions are not referring to social acceptance or approval of protocol improvement proposals or WIPs but
> rather to whether the software actually includes code that implements a set of protocol rules, and is ready to
> enforce those rules.

Activation of protocol improvements is never a trivial matter in any public and decentralized blockchain network.
Beyond the politics of gathering social consensus around a protocol improvement proposal and coordinating all the
actors involved in the operation of the network (miners, users, developers, exchanges, etc.), there are also
technical challenges that need to be addressed for conducting the upgrade with no major risk to the stability and
security of the network.

These technical challenges and risks are naturally different for each specific blockchain protocol. In the case of
Witnet, as finality and liveness are highly reliant on the outcome of each subsequent superblock voting round, new
protocol rules must enter into force only once a supermajority of nodes in the network are upgraded to the new
version. Otherwise, chances are that the network ends up in a "halt" situation in which the needed 2/3rds consensus
is almost impossible to reach.

A clear example of an unintended network halt during a coordinated upgrade is the  activation of [WIP-0009], [WIP-0011]
and [WIP-0012] on 28 April 2021. Despite these WIPs receiving overall positive comments and no major objections from
the community, by the time they were expected to enter into force, only some 45% of the network had upgraded to the
`1.2.x` version of [witnet-rust]. This caused the network to split in two, with both sides of the split being unable
to achieve the 2/3rds consensus required for resuming block consolidation. Only after 50 hours the percentage of
upgraded nodes had grown closer to 2/3rds, a superblock was eventually consolidated by the supermajority chain, a
fresh new *Active Reputation Set (ARS)* emerged, and consensus continued as usual, with over 90% average convergence
and no single chain rollback ever since.

Even though automatic network halts effectively prevent any nodes from ending up irreversibly forked, it becomes
evident that protocol improvements could be activated in a much safer way if support for them is explicitly signaled,
and the new protocol rules only come into force once the network has shown widespread support for them over a period
of time, so that all nodes start enforcing the new protocol rules at once, with zero downtime.

This document addresses:
- means for mining nodes to signal support for new sets of protocol rules,
- a mechanism for activating those rules may those nodes eventually signal an overwhelming support for them,
- changes to the [WIP Process][WIP-0001] so as to rule the interactions between WIP authors and editors in the
context of automated activation of protocol improvements.

## Specification

> For the meaning of "support" in the context of this document, please read the disclaimer in the motivation section.

### Signaling support for protocol improvements

**(1)** The unused `version` field in the block header data structure is repurposed for containing the support
signals, and renamed as `signals`.

**(2)** Each of the 32 bits of the `signals` field is "flagging" support or lack thereof for a different protocol
improvement, alike to a [bit field] formed by 32 individual *signaling bits*. In other words, the binary value of
the bit at position `n` represents an `n + 1`th protocol improvement, where value `1` means *"the protocol
improvement is supported"* and value `0` means *"the protocol improvement is not yet supported"*.

As an example, the binary string `0b10000000000000000000000000000101` is encoding support for the first, third, and
thirty-second protocol improvements (signaling bits `0`, `2` and `31`), and lack of support for any other.

Checking whether the `n`th protocol improvement is supported can be efficiently computed by performing a couple of
bitwise operations:

```python=
let nth_is_supported = (signals & (1 << (n - 1))) != 0
```

**(3)** The default value of `signals` is `0b00000000000000000000000000000001`. This default value implicitly
signals support for all the features existing in the protocol before the adoption of this proposal, plus the protocol
improvements described herein. The `1.2.3` release of [witnet-rust] acts as a reference of what these implicit features
are.

Assignment of each signaling bit position to specific protocol improvements is discussed later in *[Changes to WIP
 Process](#Changes-to-WIP-Process)*.

**(4)** Protocol clients implementing the logic of a protocol improvement that is to be activated through the
procedure described in this document MUST guard the new piece(s) of logic behind a verification that prevents that
code from executing before the protocol improvement is considered *active* as per (13).

### Keeping track of support for protocol improvements

**(5)** Upon consolidating a block into the chain (by means of superblock confirmation), each node MUST take note of
the protocol improvements that the block is signaling support for. Nodes MUST accumulate those signals as counters,
and every time a block is consolidated such that it signals support for one or more protocol improvements, the
counters representing those protocol improvements MUST be increased by 1.

As an example, here is JavaScript pseudocode for accumulating the count of votes for each specific improvement bit:
```javascript=
let signals = block.signals

for (let n = 0; n < 32; n++) {
  signal_counters[n] = (signal_counters[n] || 0) + signals & 1
  signals >>= 1
}
```

**(6)** Nodes that are synchronizing the chain through inventory requests MUST follow the same procedure as
described in (5), with the only difference that they can increase the signal counters as soon as they write the
validated blocks into their storage and local chain state, with no need to wait for superblock confirmation.

**(7)** A new `signaling_period_epochs` protocol-level consensus constant is introduced, such that it:

1. is not taken into account for computing the protocol version (a.k.a. *"magic number"*),
2. is always expressed in protocol epochs, and
3. is set to `26_880` (twenty-six thousand, eight hundred and eighty epochs), equivalent to 14 days.

**(8)** All signal counters from (5) must be reset to zero upon entering protocol epochs multiple of
`signaling_period_epochs`.

This periodic reset at specific protocol epoch heights effectively creates *"signaling time frames"* that always
start on epochs that are multiple of `signaling_period_epochs`, and finish one epoch before the next multiple of
`signaling_period_epochs`.

As an example, here is JavaScript pseudocode for resetting the counters upon changing epochs:

```javascript=
# This need to be executed as soon as the protocol changes epochs
if (current_epoch % signaling_period_epochs === 0) {
    signal_counters = {}
}
```

**(9)** Each protocol improvement to be activated through this mechanism MUST be associated to a `first_signaling_epoch`
number that marks the first epoch in its first signaling time frame such that:

1. the `first_signaling_epoch` MUST be a multiple of `signaling_period_epochs`,
2. counting signals for a protocol change MAY NOT be necessary for epochs prior to its `first_signaling_epoch`, and
3. a protocol change MUST not be considered supported enough nor active before one complete signaling time frame has
 happened following its `first_signaling_epoch`.

### Eventual activation of a protocol improvement that is supported enough

**(10)** A new `signaling_threshold_percentage` protocol-level consensus constant is introduced, such that it:

1. is not taken into account for computing the protocol version (a.k.a. *"magic number"*),
2. is always expressed in integer percentages, and
3. is set to `80` (eighty), meaning 80% (eighty percent).

**(11)** A protocol improvement is considered *"supported enough"* as soon as more than `signaling_period_epoch*
signaling_threshold_percentage / 100` blocks signaled support for it over a period of `signaling_period_epoch` epochs
starting with any epoch whose number is greater than or equal to its `first_signaling_epoch`, and is a multiple of
`signaling_period_epoch`, as in (8) and (9).

In other words, an improvement proposal is supported enough when its corresponding signals counter equals or exceeds
`signaling_period_epoch * signaling_threshold_percentage / 100` at any time after its `first_signaling_epoch`.

For the inital values of `signaling_period_epoch` and `signaling_threshold_percentage` set in (7.3) and (9.3), the
number of supporting blocks required to activate a protocol improvement is `21_504` (twenty-one thousand, five
hundred and four).

**(12)** Once a protocol improvement is considered *supported enough*, activation is irrevocable.

**(13)** A protocol improvement is active and enters into force starting with the 21th epoch after the first block
that has an epoch number greater than the last epoch belonging to the first signaling time frame in which it
achieved the *supported enough* status.

This delay of 21 epochs equates to waiting for finality / superblock confirmation so as to prevent different nodes
in the network from taking different activation decisions in the case that a protocol improvement is supported by
little below or over the threshold, and a fork at the block chain level happens.

**(14)** Once a protocol improvement is activated through this procedure, it will remain active for all the following
protocol epochs, regardless of whether the improvement lacks enough support in any of the subsequent signaling time
frames.

**(15)** Protocol clients which implement the logic of a protocol improvement MUST start enforcing that logic as soon
as it becomes active.

**(16)** Protocol clients which introduced guards as per (4) SHOULD remove and SHOULD NOT have those guards in any
further releases happening later than the activation epoch.

**(17)** Once a protocol improvement is activated through this procedure, the set of protocol rules that it
introduces become part of the core Witnet protocol. Consequently, protocol clients that implement the logic of a
protocol improvement for the first time after the improvement has become active as per (13) MUST NOT put the logic
of the protocol improvement behind any guard, i.e. they are exempt from (4).

### Changes to WIP Process

**(18)** As a rule of thumb, all future WIPs in the *Consensus* layer as defined by [WIP-0001] SHOULD be signaled for
support and eventually activated as provided for by this document.

**(19)** For a *Consensus* layer WIP to be promoted from *Draft* to *Proposed* state, its *Adoption Plan* section
MUST explicitly propose activation through the process described in this document.

**(20)** When promoting a *Consensus* layer WIP from *Draft* to *Proposed* state, the WIP editor MUST assign a
signaling bit position to the protocol improvements proposed in the WIP under consideration. When assigning
signaling bit positions, the following rules MUST be abided by:

1. Bit positions MUST be assigned in increasing order, e.g. first bit 0, then bit 1, etc.
2. Each WIP SHOULD be signaled by a single bit position.
3. The protocol improvements proposed by a single WIP cannot be split into multiple bit positions.
4. Exceptionally, multiple WIPs MAY use the same bit position and eventually become active at once, provided that
the following requirements are met:
    1. The two or more WIPs to be jointly signaled and activated MUST be in the *Draft* state.
    2. The two or more WIPs MUST explicitly propose joint activation in their *Adoption Plan*.
    3. The champions of the two or more WIPs MUST jointly ask the WIP editor for using the same bit position.
5. Once all positions have been assigned, the next WIP that requires a position MUST be assigned position 0. Any
subsequent assignments will follow Rule (19.1).
6. All position assignments MUST be publicly listed in the README file of the WIP repository, and it is the WIP
editor's responsibility to maintain that list up to date.

**(21)** Notwithstanding (18) and (19), activation through any other means is still possible in the event that such
other process offers better guarantees or the community simply deems it appropriate. If that is the case, the
*Adoption Plan* MUST explicitly opt-out of the process described in this document, and explain in detail how the
other process will work.

**(22)** WIPs that propose protocol improvements by means of the mechanism described in this document are considered
Final as soon as the protocol improvements proposed therein become active as per (13).

## Backwards compatibility

### Definitions

- Implementer: a client that implements or adopts the mechanism proposed in this document.
- Non-implementer: a client that fails to or refuses to implement or adopt the mechanism proposed in this document.

### Consensus cheat sheet

Immediately upon entry into force of the proposed mechanism:

- Blocks and transactions that were considered valid by former versions of the protocol MUST continue to be
 considered valid.
- Blocks and transactions produced by non-implementers MUST be validated by implementers using the same rules as
 with those coming from implementers, that is, the new rules.
- Non-implementers SHOULD get their valid blocks accepted by implementers.
- Implementers SHOULD get their valid blocks accepted by non-implementers.

However, after a first protocol improvement is accepted:
- Non-implementers MAY NOT get their valid blocks accepted by implementers.
- Implementers MAY NOT get their valid blocks accepted by non-implementers.
- Non-implementers MAY consolidate different blocks and superblocks than implementers.

Due to this last point, this MUST be considered a consensus-critical protocol improvement. An adoption plan MUST be
 proposed, setting an activation date that gives miners enough time in advance to upgrade their existing clients.

### Libraries, clients and interfaces

The protocol improvements proposed herein will affect any library or client implementing the core Witnet block chain
 protocol, especially block production and consolidation.

Protocol clients MAY allow end users to explicitly oppose a protocol improvement by providing configuration options
 for setting the corresponding signaling bit to `0`.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation for the proposed protocol improvements can be found as an [integration branch in the
witnet-rust repository][tapi].

## Adoption Plan

An activation date is proposed for July 13 2021 at 9am UTC, that is, protocol epoch #522240.

From the perspective of TAPI, the `first_signaling_epoch` for the base implicit signal (
`0b00000000000000000000000000000001`) is also set to #522240.
