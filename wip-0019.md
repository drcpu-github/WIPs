## Abstract

A new type of data source is proposed to leverage the crowd-attestation mechanism of the Witnet protocol to enable
Random Number Generation (RNG) functionality inside data requests.


## Motivation and rationale

Just in the same way as price feeds are the fundamental oracle-based building block for many DeFi protocols RNGs are
quickly becoming a keystone building block for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Many use cases are arising in which the smart contracts generating the NFTs are in need of reliable and tamper-proof
random inputs for their generative algorithms ensuring the "uniqueness" of each piece. That is, they need to randomly
assign a distinguishable set of scarce attributes or traits to each newly minted NFT unit.

The case for oracle-powered RNGs expands beyond NFTs, as many other constructs also benefit from random inputs, e.g.
in the area of gaming, lotteries, gambling, random committee selection, etc.

Due to the robustness and flexibility of the crowd-attestation mechanism of the Witnet protocol, there is a huge
opportunity to add RNG capabilities to it with very little and self-contained changes.

In particular, the mechanism hereby introduced consists of a new type of data source in which no external HTTP(S)
servers are queried, and nodes are instead required to secretly commit secret sequences of bytes. The rest of the
protocol follows in the traditional way, with the only addition of a new reducer function that concatenates the
revealed values in a deterministic order and hashes the sequence together so as to produce a single, uniform and
pseudo-random output that will be used as the result of the request.

Additionally, a new deterministic ordering for reveals inside tally transactions is introduced so as to rule out any
malleability attempt from tally producers. 

Due to the overlap of Witnet's inherent commitment scheme with this last aggregation step, there is no need for the
committed bytes to be verifiably random. Under the assumptions of stock hashing functions, even if the committers
collude around crafting their commitments in such a way that the output is favorable to them, as long as 1 single
committer remains independent and commits a value that is secret to the rest, the final result will hold the desired
randomness properties.

In this construction, the assumptions for reveal censorship are still the same as for the base witnessing protocol.
It is assumed that miners will not coordinate to censor specific reveals with a view to manipulate RNG outputs, given
that they cannot predict whether their block candidates will be accepted by the rest of the network, and that there
exists an economic incentive in form of rewards for non-coordinated miners to include the missing (censored) reveals
into their own block proposals.

## Specification

### Introduction of data request type `1`

**(1)** A new type of data source is introduced with name `Rng` and identifier `1`.

**(2)** Type `1` sources have the same `script` attribute as type `0` sources, but no `url` attribute.

**(3)** The script field in type `1` sources use the same RADON operators and encoding as type `0`.

### Retrieval of type `1` sources

**(4)** When retrieving a type `1` source, a node SHOULD generate on the spot a random and secret sequence of 32
bytes.

**(5)** This random and secret sequence of 32 bytes MUST be used as the result of the retrieval. 

### Reveal of data requests containing type `1` sources

**(6)** Data requests containing type `1` sources MUST be revealed normally.

### Ordering of reveals in tally transactions

**(7)** When producing and validating tally transactions, reveals must be listed and considered in increasing order
of the big-endian value of the `SHA256` hash of the concatenation of each revealer's 20-bytes Public Key Hash followed
by the 32-bytes ID of the data request.

```rust
// Rust-alike pseudocode
reveals.sort(|reveal| {
  let mut data = Vec::new();
  data.extend(reveal.body.pkh.bytes);
  data.extend(data_request_id.bytes);

  sha256(data)
});
```

### Addition of a `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer

**(8)** A new reducer function with code `0x0B` and name `ConcatenateAndHash` is introduced.

**(9)** The `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer function is a general purpose reducer function: it can be used as a reducer
in the RADON scripts of any type of data sources, as well as in the reducing step of the aggregation and tally stages.

**(10)** The `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer function only accepts a non-empty homogeneous `Array` of byte sequences as its
input. That is, an `Array` containing one or more items of the `Bytes` type.

**(11)** May the `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer function be applied on an input not satisfying (10), the output MUST be an
error of type `UnsupportedReducer` (error code `0x12`).

**(12)** May any of the `Bytes` items in the `Array` used as an input for the `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer function be
comprised of less than 32 bytes, the bytes will be padded with zeroes on the most significant byte side, in such a way
that the big-endian value of the sequence remains the same.

**(13)** May any of the `Bytes` items in the `Array` used as an input for the `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer function be
comprised of more than 32 bytes, only the 32 less significant bytes will be used.

**(14)** The output of the  `ConcatenateAndHash` reducer function will be computed as the `SHA256` hash of the
concatenation of all the `Bytes` items in the `Array` after being padded or trimmed if needed as specified in (12) and
(13).


## Backwards compatibility

- Implementer: a client that implements or adopts the protocol improvements proposed in this document.
- Non-implementer: a client that fails to or refuses to implement the protocol improvements proposed in this document.

#### Consensus cheat sheet

Upon entry into force of the proposed improvements:

- Blocks and transactions that were considered valid by former versions of the protocol MUST continue to be considered valid.
- Blocks and transactions produced by non-implementers MUST be validated by implementers using the same rules as with those coming from implementers, that is, the new rules.
- Implementers MUST apply the proposed logic when evaluating transactions or computing their own data request eligibility.

As a result:

- Non-implementers MAY NOT get their blocks and transactions accepted by implementers.
- Implementers MAY NOT get their valid blocks accepted by non-implementers.
- Non-implementers MAY consolidate different blocks and superblocks than implementers.

Due to this last point, this MUST be considered a consensus-critical protocol improvement. An adoption plan MUST be proposed, setting an activation date that gives miners enough time in advance to upgrade their existing clients.

### Libraries, clients, and interfaces

The protocol improvements proposed herein will affect any library or client implementing any of the functionality
related to the RAD engine. For example, this is the case of the [Sheikah][sheikah] data request editor and `witnet
-requests-js` Javascript library.

In the case of `witnet-requests-js`, which did not provide for different types of data sources and rather assumed
`HttpGet`, the following syntax is suggested:

```js
// HttpGet (type 0) source
const request = new Witnet.Request()
  .addHttpGetSource(/* url */)

// Default source type should also be HttpGet (type 0) for backwards compatibility
const request = new Witnet.Request()
  .addSource(/* url */)

// RNG (type 1) source
const request = new Witnet.Request()
  .addRandomSource()

// Source types can be mixed, as long as their output types match
const request = new Witnet.Request()
  .addHttpGetSource(/* url */)
  .addRandomSource()
```
  

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation for the proposed protocol improvement can be found in the [pull request #2053](https://github.com/witnet/witnet-rust/pull/2053) of the [witnet-rust] repository.


## Adoption Plan

An activation date is proposed for September 21 2021 at 9am UTC, that is, protocol epoch #656640.

From the perspective of TAPI, this proposal will be signaled along with the WIP-0017. The signaling bit is `1` (`0b00000000000000000000000000000010`) and the `first_signaling_epoch` is set to #656640.

## Acknowledgements

This proposal has been cooperatively discussed and devised by many individuals from the Witnet development community.
